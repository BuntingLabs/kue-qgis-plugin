# Kue

> Kue is an embedded AI inside QGIS. You can use Kue to edit symbology, search
for datasets, add basemaps, and more.

### Data Security

Kue sends a limited amount of QGIS project data to the cloud for LLM processing.
This includes:
- Layer names
- Attribute names one row of values per layer

We are actively building an on-premise alternative for users who would like
to keep their data private.
